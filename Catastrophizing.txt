Catastrophizing

----------------------------------------

What it is

Cognitive distortion that prompts people to jump to the worst possible conclusion, usually with very limited information or objective reason to despair. 

When a situation is upsetting, but not necessarily catastrophic, they feel like they are in the midst of a crisis.

This pattern of thinking can be destructive because unnecessary and persistent worry can lead to heightened anxiety and depression.

Situation 

When someone makes a mistake at work, they might engage in catastrophic thinking by exaggerating how poorly the error will reflect on her and concluding that she will be fired for it—and, perhaps, that this will lead to other severe consequences, like losing her home.

An airplane passenger may catastrophize by interpreting turbulence as a sign of an imminent crash. 

Someone who incorrectly assumes that a relationship, or her reputation with others, has been irreparably damaged because of some regrettable behavior could be described as catastrophizing.

	Some catastrophizing dialogues are :-

	“If I fail this test, I will never pass school, and I will be a total failure in life.”

	“If I don’t recover quickly from this procedure, I will never get better, and I will be disabled my entire life.”

	“If my partner leaves me, I will never find anyone else, and I will never be happy again.”
