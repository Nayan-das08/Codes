this program is the 'bouncy ball' sketch with following specification :-
    * there is a class for the properties and methods called 'bounce'
    * the class is stored in an external .js file scripted into index.html
    * the position of the ball is assigned (and updated) by declaring it as VECTOR.
    * the speed of the ball is VECTOR.
    * the variable for direction of motion 'x_dir' and 'y_dir' are not used.
    * the vector variable is used for the above mentioned parameters.
    * this is done as the vectors 'position' and 'velocity' are to be added and direction variables are scalar. this would make the calculation difficult, if not impossible.
