  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  This is the first webpage (And this line is out of paragraph element).

  <ol>
    <h2>
      <li>paragraph element and h2</li>
    </h2>
    <p>Not much to look around (This line is inside a paragraph element).
      So how did you like this?</p>

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <li>bold, italic and underline</li>
    </h2>
    <p>Now, let's ake some things <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>
      and <u>underlined</u> (Another paragraph element).</p>


    <hr />
    <h2>
      <li>subscript and superscript</li>
    </h2>
    <p>We've got things like A<sub>subscript</sub> and
      B<sup>subscript</sup>.</p>

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <li>break line and horizontal rule</li>
    </h2>
    <p>We can also do <br /> this i.e. a <u>break</u>
      and you can already see the <u>horizontal rule</u> above
      the sub-heading. Both of these elements are known as
      <b>empty elements</b></p>

    <hr />
    <h2>
      <li>semantics</li>
    </h2>
    <p>We can have the same effect of bold and italic with
      <strong>strong</strong> and <em>emphasis (em)</em>.
      There's also option for quottes like <blockquote>If you tell the truth,
        you don't have to remember anything. -Mark Twain</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>We could have put the quote in the paragraph like this:
      <q>If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything. -Mark Twain</q></p>
    <p>For abbreviations, we can have like this:
      <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Christine Jeyaseelan is a chemistry faculty
      at <abbr title="Amity School of Engineering And Technology">ASET</abbr></p>
