Labelling

------------------------------

What is it

A cognitive distortion in which we generalize by taking one characteristic of a person, and applying it to the whole person.

Rather than more objectively thinking about the behavior, when we engage in labeling, we globally describe the whole person. 

As a result, we view the entire person through the label,

Making one broad assumption about someone based on one isolated data point, or just a few data points, is almost always inaccurate.

	distorted way of thinking about things

	can fuel and maintain painful emotions

	Furthermore, if you believe the label, identifying as a failure, you won’t know what to do to solve the problem. 

	Failing a test means you need to study more. Problem solved. Failing in life however… What do you do to solve that?

Because the person responded in a abrupt manner, he is a jerk

	That person is late to work. I failed the test. She spoke to me brusquely. 
	You may find that fewer negative feelings are stirred by being more objective.
